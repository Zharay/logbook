## Frequently Asked Questions

#### How do I use this?
Logbook requires that you connect your browser through an internal proxy server hosted by Logbook. In your browser/viewer of choice, you must set the following proxy settings:
* IP Address: 127.0.0.1
* Port: 8888

If done correctly, it will automatically pick up your game of Kancolle as soon as you visit the main menu or perform an action.

#### Is this safe?
Logbook only looks at the packets coming into your browser and uses that information to display all information that it can. It **does not** affect the packets in any way.

#### This is too simple!
Try out [KanColleViewer (KCV)](https://github.com/Zharay/KanColleViewer). The idea for Logbook is to be as exhaustive as possible with the simplest UI possible.

#### A ship/item is missing a translation!
